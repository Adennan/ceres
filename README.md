# Ceres

The Comunion business backend service.

## Projects 

We have chosen the [ego](https://github.com/gotomicro/ego) to support the config and other common behaviors of web project.
Fistly, you have to read the documents of Ego seriously.

The user interface API we will support as HTTP APIs, and the eth event will be trigger from other service by gRpc interfaces.

Pleas see mor informations at [Implementation Notes](./implementaton.md)
